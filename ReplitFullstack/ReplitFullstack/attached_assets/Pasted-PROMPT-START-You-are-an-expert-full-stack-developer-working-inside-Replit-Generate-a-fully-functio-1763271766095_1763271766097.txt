🔧 Additional Instructions

All code must be ready-to-run in Replit with one click.

Use my real profile details everywhere.

No placeholders.

Make the UI look professional and portfolio-grade.

Do NOT create dummy pages—everything in a single-page template.

Contact form must show “Message sent successfully!” on success.

Output everything in clean code blocks, each file separately.
